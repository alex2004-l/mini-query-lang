Mini Query Language
---
Implementation of a query language inspired by SQL _using functional programming paradigms_ with a _custom-build database in Scala_.

---
### Implementation

- ``Table operations``: insert row, delete row, sort rows, select columns, filter rows, update row.
- ``Database operations``: create, drop, select, join.
- ``Query language``: an API that allows SQL-like operations on tables and databases(__PP_SQL_DB__ and __PP_SQL_Table__). For readability, in this project are defined implicit conversions and operators.

### Usage
